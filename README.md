Build a PiggyBank!

Using the BagInterface interface, ArrayBag and Coin classes, construct a working PiggyBank class.

Use the UML diagram provided in class for data and methods

Note: Add support for half dollars to the Coin class.

Note: The new methods “Coin removeCoin(int amount)” and “double getBalance()” in PiggyBank should be implemented using existing ArrayBag methods. 

Note: The new “double getBalance()” method should return the total value of coins currently in the PiggyBank in dollars and cents, i.e., a double.

Note: The new “Coin removeCoin(int amount)” method should remove a coin of any year that is of the amount specified.

Note: The main() method in your testing program should provide ample code to sufficiently test the PiggyBank class.

Hint: Think, i.e., look at what you have, devise a solid algorithm, then start coding (and not before.)

Hint: Build getBalance() first.
